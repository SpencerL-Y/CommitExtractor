ANALYSIS: This commit addresses multiple aspects within the MMC subsystem, including a fix for a regression in the mmc ioctl, adjustments in power management support, and the initialization of mmc_blk_ioc_data. While the changes are specific to the MMC (MultiMediaCard) subsystem and primarily concern hardware interaction (e.g. SD cards), they indirectly influence syscalls related to device I/O operations, such as `open`, `read`, `write`, `ioctl`, etc. However, the specific syscall behavior modified depends on if the application interacts with the MMC device directly. Direct syscall alterations may not be evident without considering the context in which these MMC-related operations are performed by user-space applications.
SYSCALL PROGRAM IN C:
INCLUDES: 
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

PROGRAM: 
int fd = open("/dev/mmcblk0", O_RDWR);
if (fd < 0) {
    perror("Failed to open device");
    return 1;
}

// Example of using ioctl to send a command to the MMC device, placeholder for specific command
int ret = ioctl(fd, MMC_IOC_CMD, &cmd);
if (ret < 0) {
    perror("ioctl failed");
    return 1;
}

close(fd);
